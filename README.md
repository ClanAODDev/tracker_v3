## Laravel Refactor

This branch is dedicated to the migration of the tracker to the [Laravel framework](https://laravel.com/). With it, a lot of muddled and confused tendencies are being redone. The goal is to end with a project that
* Uses a modern framework that can then be updated as new releases occur
* Has a consistent and readable structure
* Allows for easier integration of components
* Enables easier contribution
