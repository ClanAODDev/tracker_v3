                <ul>
                    <li>Added application changelog</li>
                    <li>Implemented
                        <code>Reset member assignments</code> function on the member profile page to resolve
                        erroneous
                        platoon, squad assignments. This is for quickly resolving "disappearing" member issues, as
                        well
                        as convenience for members transferring out of a division.
                    </li>
                    <li>Added unassigned members area to division view, deprecating the unassigned member area in
                        the
                        platoon edit view. This will be removed in a later update.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Note: the manage members area deprecates the unassigned member in the squad edit
                                view.
                                This will also be removed at the same time.

                        leave of
                        absence.
                    </li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>New recruits will be flagged as pending to prevent the forum sync from erroneously
                                resetting assignment information (because they are not listed as active). Pending
                                member
                                (and Ex-AOD) statuses will now reflect on the member profile page.
