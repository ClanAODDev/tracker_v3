## Tracker

Rough notes here. Needs some cleaning up.

- Forum officer role (Division Officers)
- Agreed upon abbreviation (short-hand version of a division name. IE., Battlefield => bf, World of Warcraft => wow
- Forum Form Application (IE., https://www.clanaod.net/forums/forms.php?do=form&fid=34)
- Ingame handle (developer or platform specific). There's a good chance it already exists. If not, make a new one (
  tracker admin cp => Handles)
- Division icon - this should **come from the official game binary** and can be extracted
  using [BeCyIconGrabber](https://jarlpenguin.github.io/BeCyIconGrabberPortable/) (48x48 PNG). If you are unsure how
  to use this, ask around. Store the division icon
  at [public/images/game_icons/48x48](https://github.com/ClanAODDev/tracker_v3/tree/main/public/images/game_icons/48x48)
  using the division abbreviation.

### Creating divisions in Admin CP

- Name: Provide the full proper name of the division
- Slug: Sluggified version of the name. This should be lower-case and hyphenated. No other characters.
- Abbreviation: should match the forum. **Always lowercase. This is important.**
- Officer role id: Id of the role/group created in the forums. You can find this under Forum Admin > Usergroups > Id
  listed on the right-hand side in the "Edit" dropdown
- Handle: Should already exist. Pick the most appropriate one. More information provided below regarding handles.
- Forum app ID: The form id of the division application
- Settings: Leave this blank. It'll be populated later.
- Created At, Updated At: Currently defaults to blank. Set this to today's date.
- Description: Provide some appropriate sub-title for the division.
- Active: Self-explanatory

### Ingame Handles

Handles are ingame names that a member can have across the variety of platforms of games AOD plays. Steam, Battlenet,
and Bungie are just a few examples. Some games (like Warships) have their own specific ingame handle. Since handles are
used in a variety of ways, it's important to make sure the handle is configured correctly.

- Label: Mostly cosmetic. Give it a proper name.
- Type: This is less obvious (and probably needs some UI improvement), but it's the snake_case version of the name. IE.,
  Bungie => bungie_id.
- Comments: mostly guidance, not required
- URL: This is the deeplink URL, if the platform provides it. Ensure that the URL is configured so that the unique
  profile/member id can be appended to the end. Not all platforms offer this.

### Additional cosmetic items

#### Website pages

Since divisions automatically appear on the website when they are populated in the tracker, a new problem arises: the
link to the division leads to a 404. To remedy this, a division page must be created as soon as possible to ensure that
traffic doesn't get lost, and divisions actually have a way to recruit people (or at least send them to the correct
form).

The website repository is publicly accessible and anyone can contribute changes - even directly through the UI. But
you'll need a GitHub account to do so.

- Go to the AOD Repo and look at division page
  content: https://github.com/ClanAODDev/aod_site_v2/tree/main/resources/views/division/content
- Copy content from an existing division and make a new file. Look at multiple divisions so you can get a sense for
  what's possible and how to do it correctly. Stick with basic html formatting elements (`p, ul, strong, underline, em,
  etc`)
- Update content as necessary. Preserve the html structure (classnames, element ordering).
- Ask Arch or myself to update the website with changes from the repo. At some point we'll automate this so that PRs
  automatically get deployed. For now, it's manual.

Templates are structured such that H2 header elements will automatically generate a button at the top of the page,
providing a table of contents to navigate. The ID can be anything, as long as it's unique, and uses
the-correct-character-structure.

#### Division page headers

Header images are based on
a [preexisting photoshop template](https://github.com/ClanAODDev/aod_site_v2/blob/main/public/images/division-headers/division-header-template.psd).
Notice that the actual image should be the bottom layer of the image. _It should also not include any
logos or text, and should generally be official game art, not fan-made._ It should be exported as
a `.jpg` and added to the [aod_site_v2/public/images/division-headers](https://github.com/ClanAODDev/aod_site_v2/tree/main/public/images/division-headers)
folder using the **division abbreviation (LOWERCASE)**.

Only add game artwork underneath the "division content" folder layer. Do not make any other changes to the template, or
it will break other elements of the site.

Assuming you provided a forum_app_id on the tracker, an "apply" button will send them directly to your division
application. This is automatically added to the page. **If the apply button takes you to a 404, it's because you're
missing the forum_app_id for the division on the tracker.**

#### Tracker banner

This is the image that is displayed at the top of the tracker for members of the division, if one exists. The way this
image gets created is by taking the same image used on the website into a new photoshop canvas (must be transparent),
adding the image, and reducing the opacity to 8-10%. You can take an existing tracker banner and remove the content to
make things easier.

You can see existing headers here: https://github.com/ClanAODDev/tracker_v3/tree/main/public/images/headers

Note the naming convention - use the abbreviation and ensure you export as a transparent PNG.

### Forum Permission Duplication

While vBulletin supports hierachical permissions, it can be complicated to get correct. Because of this, we use template
forums to copy permissions from.

- `Permission Setup (Anyone)`: Public forum
- `Permission Setup (Anyone Reply)`: News forum (only forum moderators can create threads)
- `Permission Setup (AOD Only)`: Members only forum
- `Permission Setup (AOD Sgts+)`: Sgt+ forum
- `Permission Setup (AOD SSgt+)`: SSgt+ forum

1. Open the [AdminCP](https://www.clanaod.net/forums/admincp/index.php)
2. Open the `Forums & Moderators` section in the left menu
3. Click `Forum Permissions`
4. In the `Additional Functions` section, click `Permission Duplication Tools`

   for `Copy Permissions from Forum`
6. Select the appropriate forum(s) to copy permissions to.
7. Set `Overwrite Duplicate Entries` to `Yes`
8. Set `Overwrite Inherited Entries` to `Yes`
9. Click `Go`

#### Officer Forum Permissions

Officer and other specialized forums do not have simple templates to copy from. To apply permissions, start with the
next higher permissions template and adjust.

Officer Forums must start with `Permission Setup (AOD Sgts+)`.

To add officer group permissions after duplicating Sgt+ permissions:

1. Open the [AdminCP](https://www.clanaod.net/forums/admincp/index.php)
2. Open the `Forums & Moderators` section in the left menu
3. Click `Forum Permissions`
4. Search for the officer forum by name
5. Underneath the forum name, find the `{Division Name} Officers` group and click `[Edit]`
6. Set permissions according to the forum moderator template.
7. Click `Save`

the [Forum Member List](https://www.clanaod.net/forums/showroster.php) to confirm.

## Discord

Discord is managed entirely through the `ClanAOD.net Forum Bot` using slash commands. For help with the bot,
use `/help command:division` to see all available division commands.

### Adding a Division

To add a division in Discord, ensure the Division has first been created in Tracker and that the appropriate Officers
group has been created on the forums.

Auto complete for `/division add` will show divisions that exist in the tracker that have not yet been added to discord.
While you can type a custom name, it is highly recommended to use auto complete.

#### Forum Sync Map

The forum sync process maps Discord roles to forum groups. When creating a division, the bot will automatically
choose `{Division Name} Officers` to map to the `{Division Name} Officer` role. If the forum group does not exist or the
bot cannot find it, an error will be reported during division creation.

TODO: Add steps for manual mapping

### Deleting a Division

Auto complete for `/division delete` will show divisions that exist in the tracker that have been added to discord.
While you can type a custom name, it is highly recommended to use auto complete.

## TeamSpeak

AOD's server. Please contact Archangel to add or remove group maps.
