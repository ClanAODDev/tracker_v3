<h3>User Access Matrix</h3>

<p>User access to various tracker functionality is largely based on the permissions model used on the AOD forums, with a couple exceptions.</p>

<p>Policies govern all actions that can be taken on the tracker. This includes things like creating, editing, and deleting platoons and squads. The matrix below breaks down each role, and what actions are permitted.</p>

<table class="table table-striped table-hover">

        <th>Member Management</th>
        <th>Remove Members</th>
