### TS Moderation

* Moving members - Always ask permission first - try to have them move you to another channel - Do not abuse
* Kicking/Banning - Remind them that they cannot reverse a permanent ban - Have them try and kick you, ask them if they know what they cannot.
* Adding Channels - Have them create both a Temp and Semi-Perminate Channel - Explain the use cases for both.
* CO/XO should be consulted before changing any permanent channel in the Division's area
