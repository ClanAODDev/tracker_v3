#### Duties and Responsibilities

##### Explain the differences in responsibilities between a Cpl and a Sgt in AOD

* Understand that your area of responsibility as a SGT now expands beyond that of your division. Members from other divisions may come to you for assistance when their leadership is not available.
* Take care not to step on any toes or make decisions that depart from that division's norms. Utilize the [SGT Decision Log](https://www.clanaod.net/forums/showthread.php?t=79087) when forced to take action, and document fully.
* Stay in your Lane: Strive to be helpful but don't meddle or otherwise interfere.
* COs in any division are the final say in any matters pertaining to their divisions. Know this, Live this and Love this.
