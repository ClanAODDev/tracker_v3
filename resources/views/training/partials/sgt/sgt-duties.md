<h3>Duties and Responsibilities</h3>
<ul>
    <h4>Explain the differences in responsibilities between a Cpl and a Sgt in AOD</h4>
    
    <li>Understand that your area of responsibility as a SGT now expands beyond that of your division. Members from
        other divisions may come to you for assistance when their leadership is not available.
    <li>Take care not to step on any toes or make decisions that depart from that division's norms. Utilize the
        <a href="https://www.clanaod.net/forums/showthread.php?t=79087">SGT Decision Log</a> when forced to take action, and document fully.
    </li>
    <li>Stay in your Lane: Strive to be helpful but don't meddle or otherwise interfere.</li>
    <li>COs in any division are the final say in any matters pertaining to their divisions. Know this, Live this and Love this.
