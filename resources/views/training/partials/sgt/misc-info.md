#### Misc Information

* Point out that they can now see who has looked at a post on the forum. Discuss the use cases of this feature
* Remind them that Taptalk does not update this data.
* Have them browse some of the other division forums and let them know that they can now see all divisions Sgts areas in both the forums and Discord.
* Remind them that they are a guest in those areas and to act appropriately.
* Point out that stealing good ideas from other divisions is encouraged, with credit given as appropriate. Discuss with CO/XO before implementation, however.
* Ask them how they cook their steaks, if they say **'in the Microwave'** then no further action is needed. If they say anything else, tell them how very wrong they are.

##### Offer to have the Sgt check with you if they have any further questions. Arrange a time in about week after training to follow up with the now trained Sgt to check in and see how they are doing in the role
