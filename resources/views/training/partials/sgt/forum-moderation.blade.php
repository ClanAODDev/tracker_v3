<h4>Forum Moderation</h4>
<p>
    Review how to make announcements on the forums.
    Show them the Forum Manager link (a second way to post announcements (easier IMO)
    Go over Search for users, Search IP addresses. Give examples of why you would use that
    feature. Explain why you
    would Edit AOD info (promotions, demotions). Remind them of the poor placement of the
    "Remove Member" button and
    to be careful.
    Review the Ban User feature, Do not gloss over this. Spend some time discussing it.
    Banning
    is never an
    emotional response. It is a tool to protect AOD from threats that could hinder the clan.
    Make sure they
    understand that they need to remove AOD membership status before banning. Make sure the
    ban
    is permanent and
    that a reason is given for the ban. Discuss reversing a ban, and the does and don't.
    When in
    doubt seek higher
    authority. Review a few bans in the Sgt section for appropriate structure.
    Review award section and how to assign an award. Show them where the Request for new
    Awards
    sticky is in the Sgt
    section.
