#### SGT Structure & SSgts Duties

##### Review both the Sgt structure and the SSgt lists below.

Reference the [leadership structure](https://tracker.clanaod.net/reports/leadership) for guidance on who is a Sgt in AOD and what their role is.

##### Explain briefly what a SSgt's role is:

* SSgts are responsible for the onboarding and training of all newly promoted Sgts.
* SSgts also monitor, edit and guide along the Division Request Forums in conjunction with prospective division leaders (usually other Sgts). SSgts should step in if a division request goes off the rails, or lies dormant for an excessive period of time.
* SSgts are experienced Sgts who typically will hold CO or XO tags in their division. They are the first stop for any Sgt who has questions about how to perform their tasks.
* Your trainee Sgt should come away from this conversation with an understanding that they are part of a highly organized structure, and that there is always someone there to help if they get stuck. Take ownership of their development and offer to help them if they have any questions.
    
**Be sure to plan time in the coming days and weeks to check on their progress.**
