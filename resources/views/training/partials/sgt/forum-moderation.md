#### Forum Moderation

##### Review Basic Forum Moderation Functions

* Go over Search for users: Remind them of the poor placement of the `Ban User` button and to be careful.
* Search IP addresses: Give example use-cases for this feature.
* Explain why/how to Edit AOD info (promotions, demotions).

##### Review the Ban User feature, Do not gloss over this.

* Banning is never an emotional response. It is a tool to protect AOD from threats that could hinder the clan.
* Make sure they understand that they need to remove AOD membership status before banning.
* Make sure the ban is permanent and that a reason is given for the ban.
* Discuss reversing a ban, and the do's and don't. When in doubt seek higher authority.
* Review [past bans in the Sgt section](https://www.clanaod.net/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=339) to ensure that they know the correct format.

#### Review award section and how to assign an award.

* Review the process on how to assign an award. Try testing by having them grant and revoke an award for you.
