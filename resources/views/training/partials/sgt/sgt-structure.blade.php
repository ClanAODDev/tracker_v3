<h4>SGT Structure</h4>
<p>
    Review both the Sgt structure and the SSgt lists below. Explain briefly what a SSgt's role
    is. They should come away with an understanding that they are part of a highly organized structure, and that there
    is always someone there to help if they get stuck. </p>
<p>Be sure to plan time in the coming days and weeks to check on their progress.</p>
