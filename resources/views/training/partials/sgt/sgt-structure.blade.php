    </ul></p>
 
   <h4>Explain briefly what a SSgt's role is:</h4>
    <li>SSgts are responsible for the onbaording and training of all newly promoted Sgts.</li>
    <li>SSgts also monitor, edit and guide along the Division Request Forums. A SSgt should be driving the conversations around a new AOD division request and keep the forum posts updated and orderly</li>
    <li>SSgts are experienced Sgts who typically will hold CO or XO tags in their division. They are the first stop for any Sgt who has questions about how to perform their tasks</li>
    <li>Your trainee Sgt should come away from this conversation with an understanding that they are part of a highly organized structure, and that there is always someone there to help if they get stuck. Take ownership of their development and offer to help them if they have any questions</p>

<h4>Be sure to plan time in the coming days and weeks to check on their progress.</h4>
